The Adonis test package has not been migrated yet to version 5, so this project shows how to configure [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and [japa](https://github.com/thetutlage/japa) to test the server.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/iagobruno/adonis5-puppeteer-testing.git
cd adonis5-puppeteer-testing
yarn install
yarn run test
code tests\sample.spec.ts
```
